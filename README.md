# Speed-Cameras

Analyzed over 950,000 records of NYC Open Data on DOT Traffic Speed Cameras for the month of February 2023.  Explored the dataset for effectiveness of speed cameras since the inception of Vision Zero.  You can find the dataset here, https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/DOT-Traffic-Speeds-NBE/i4gi-tjb9.  I am currently unable to load the file due to its size.

# I analyzed the data for
- Hourly Speed Variations
- Weekend vs Weekend & Daily
- Number of Cameras in each Borough
- Borough with highest average speed
- Top Speed Camera Locations

# Tools
- Excel for exploration
- Python for data cleaning, analysis, visualizations, and presentation
  
# Data Findings

- An average city speed of over 35mph between hours of 10pm-5am with only 3 mph difference between weekday and weekends
- Daily average city speed was always over 30 mph with highest on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.  Surprisingly it is lowest on Fridays.
- The highest speeds were recorded in Queens and the Bronx, even though Queens is the borough with most speed cameras.
